# DaniDojo
 A mod to allow players to play DaniDojo mode in TDMX.\
\
This is a very alpha version of the mod.\
\
There's a decent chance the mod won't work at all without having the proper assets\
This is something I have some plans for in the future, I will not distribute the assets here\


[A vague roadmap for the mod can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fuAAfK-0Vw74TwxXF5WVy1fh1ADsVzUkDd7dOHc7EdQ/edit#gid=1112016116)\
I will not guarantee that everything on this roadmap will be possible, or completed, nor will I give any sort of timeframe.


This only has support for the Mono (1.2.2) version of the game.
